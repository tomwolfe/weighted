# Weighted

Weighted helps you to pick items from a collection by it's weight/probability.

Inspired by [Stackexchange solution](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/150618) and a (probably) nicer solution: [Pickup](https://github.com/fl00r/pickup)

# Installation

This was just a quick hack, too lazy to make a gem especially since Pickup is much more elegant.

Modify run.rb's call to Weighted.new and pass in a hash with items as the keys and occurances as the values.
Then just run run.rb:
`ruby run.rb`
